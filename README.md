# 🚀 My DevOps Journey

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my progress, projects, and experiments as I learn the tools and practices of DevOps.

## 🎯 Goal
My goal is to build a strong foundation in DevOps by implementing real-world scenarios and scripting automation tasks. I believe in "learning by doing."

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
I organize my projects by topic/technology. As I learn new tools, I will add more folders here.

*This repository is constantly updating as I learn new technologies.*
